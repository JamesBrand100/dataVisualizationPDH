#Goal: make a line plot for the equation y = 2*x 

#step 0: import correct packages (ive imported matplotlib, but you need one other package!)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
<another import is needed here> 
#step 1: get input data
xData = np.arange(10) 
#step 2: get output data (you do this!)
<create y data here> 
#step 3: plot the data (will use matplot lib!)
plt.plot(xData, yData)
#step 4: show the data (will use matplot lib!)
<show the data here> 

#step 5: modify the graphic in a variety of ways, including: 
#axis labels
#scale
#figure size 
#title 
#changing base equation (can explore many different functions in numpy!)
